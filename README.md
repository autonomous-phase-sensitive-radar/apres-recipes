# Field Processing Scripts

This repository contains the processing scripts by George Lu used in 2022 Greenland field work. The scripts, along with their instructions, are found in the folder `field_processing_scripts`.  This main folder contains links to some data that one can test the scripts with (`data_links.md`). It also contains a spreadsheet used to calculate ApRES storage space and power usage (`ApRESCalculator.xlsx`). It is currently calculating the numbers based on the May 2022 deployment of ApRES.
