# ApRES Recipes
A collection of tools for performing specific compuational tasks related to ApRES data collection, processing, plotting, etc. contributed by the ApRES community. 

## Purpose
Multiple researchers and groups of researchers have invented (and reinvented) different methods, but the details of these methods are not always shared effectively. This repoository can act as a common location for informally sharing different approaches to ApRES data analysis or related tasks. 

## Contributing
We very much welcome contributions from the community on any aspect of ApRES data analysis. 
A suggested structure for contributions is a folder in the root of this repo containing (1) a README.md file that minimally explains the purpose of the code, and (2) a sub-directory called `code` containing the code base in whatever format you like. 
Optionally, the README file can also contain information on dependencies and usage of the code and/or examples with example data. 
Contributions can be in the form of [pull requests](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/). 
Feel free to start submit an [issue](https://github.com/autonomous-phase-sensitive-radar/apres-recipes/issues) to start a conversation about a possible contribution too!
